DAY_1: development created a couple wireframe layouts on blank paper. wrote a couple different sets of script that I think might be the correct direction to go.
DAY_1: writing the code. My first attempt at the code i had scribbled out on paper was completely wrong. going to try the second set of ideas i wrote down. hopefully thatll send me in the right direction.
DAY_1: end of day. so none of the code i planned out worked in the slightest. going to start again from scratch after getting some pointers on the direction i should go in.
DAY_1:final thoughts. well i still cant get it to print the images to the browser and i have no idea where to go from here. going to call it for the night and get some help tomorrow.

DAY_2: starting the day. well after reviewing the code in the morning it would appear that i was completely off. i had a couple aspects of my script that were correct but i didnt have it set up correctly. Now know the direction that i need to go in. I think ive got a good understanding of where i went wrong and what i was trying to do but didnt write the code correctly for what i was trying to do.
